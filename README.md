# D3 Hierarchy Sandbox

The purpose of this project is to build my understanding of D3 hierarchies. My company leverages Tableau for most visualizations, but we have several datasets
that are hierarchical. There is no way to build a macro visualization of this hierarchy _effectively_ in Tableau. Since I have used D3 before and been curious about it
for some time now, I am taking the time to refresh my Javascript, HTML, and CSS so that I can build something that _might_ be useful in D3.

From the D3 Hierarchy GitHub page:

"A good hierarchical visualization facilitates rapid multiscale inference: micro-observations of individual elements and macro-observations of large groups."

That's exactly what I'd like to accomplish here.

This project serves to start from the most basic building blocks to build my own understanding. Iteration after iteration should eventually yield my vision.
